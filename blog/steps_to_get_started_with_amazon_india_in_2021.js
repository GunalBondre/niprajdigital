                products from the store.

                  <h5 className='title4'>Register account on amazon</h5>{" "}
                  <p className='para'>
                    For registering an account on amazon you need the following
                    documents
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Goods and services tax no</li>
                    <li>Pan Card</li>
                    <li>Active bank account to receive money</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p className='para'>
                    {" "}
                    Once you register you will get access to a dashboard that
                    will help you list products to sell
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5 className='title4'>Upload your listing </h5>
                  <p className='para'>
                    The second step is to upload your listing provided you have
                    a product to sell in the first place. You don’t have a
                    product to sell don’t worry we will guide you on how to find
                    the best product to sell on amazon.
                  </p>
                  <p className='para'>
                    Now assuming you have a product to sell the next step is to
                    create a listing We are not going into details on how to
                    create a listing that will be covered here
                  </p>
                  <p className='para'>
                    So to create a listing you need to write a catchy title Then
                    add images and description and last add price And hit
                    publish It will take little time to make your listing active
                    once it is it will show in your dashboard You are good to go
                    now
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5 className='title4'>Advertise your product </h5>
                  <p className='para'>
                    So whatever product you sell there is the possibility that a
                    thousand others might be selling the same product and you
                    likely end up at bottom of the search result
                  </p>
                  <p className='para'>
                    That means visibility of your product will be very low
                    initially
                  </p>
                  <p className='para'>
                    So to overcome this we need to advertise to get few sales to
                    boost organic ranking
                  </p>{" "}
                  <p className='para'>
                    Now warning here is without reviews it will be very hard to
                    get sell even with advertising. So it is best to get a few
                    reviews from your friends and families provided they are not
                    connected to you on Facebook. Amazon will delete a review if
                    someone who is connected to you posts it so better find
                    someone who is not connected to you on social media who may
                    be friend of a friend So with a few initial reviews, you are
                    good to go or advertising
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5 className='title4'>Dispatch your first order.</h5>

                    your first order soon. Be ready to dispatch with amazon
